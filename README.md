# ðŸŽ´ cardnet â€” Real-Time Playing Card Classifier

This project builds and deploys a real-time computer vision system to detect and classify playing cards from either their front or back sides â€” including trick card backs with hidden markings.

---

## ðŸ”§ Features

- Train a CNN or fine-tune ResNet18 on card images
- Visualize predictions and Grad-CAM overlays
- Real-time webcam detection + classification loop
- Easily extendable to new card sets or marks

---

## ðŸ—‚ Structure

- `scripts/` â€” training, data collection, webcam inference
- `cardnet/` â€” core logic and model code
- `models/` â€” trained model weights
- `data/` â€” images (not tracked in Git, but expected here)

---

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cardnet
cd cardnet
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
## To Do

Built a lot of capability today. Biggest thing up next is that the model wont detect cards when theyre held in my hand. next thing to do then is to train yolo to see it and pipe yolo into the model. i have labels and images created in ``/home/alex/Documents/projects/label_studio`` so we just need to train yolo on that.
